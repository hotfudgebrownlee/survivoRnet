# survivoRnet

The goal of this project is to visualize survivor self-comparison data in a network format.

Network graphs can be used to express a wide variety of data, as demonstrated in this graphic (source in the tutorial below).

More information about working with networks in R can be found in [this excellent tutorial](https://kateto.net/network-visualization).

The data on survivor self-comparison comes from [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jB_mWyvA3oc5sPtNjHBb-MFPiWbcvEp8O47bZikxa_Y/edit#gid=0) compiled by reddit user [RGBjacob](https://www.reddit.com/user/RGBJacob/). 

Supplementary data comes from the ["survivoR" package](https://github.com/doehm/survivoR) and
the [2022 survivor Reddit census](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uDTM3mjdqMXZ1XyE4us--IWROvtCKLOB/edit#gid=1279512292) provided by reddit user (and survivor winner!) [Maryanne Oketch](https://www.reddit.com/user/maydukamo/).
